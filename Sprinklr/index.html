            <p>
              In today’s digital era, online communities are crucial for
              connecting individuals who share similar interests, goals, or
              locations. Sprinklr Community plays a pivotal role in fostering
              these connections, enabling more efficient and effective
              communication. This redesigned platform empowers brands to gain
              deeper insights into their customers' needs. Users can leverage
              these communities for gathering customer feedback, enhancing brand
              recognition, testing new ideas and products, and building strong
              customer loyalty.

            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
              As a product designer for this project, I collaborated with one
              other designer, principal designer on the Home page, and I was in
              charge for Log In, User Profile, Conversation Page and Sprinklr
              AI+ in Community design. In addition, I worked alongside Research
              team, 3 Product Managers and 2 Developer Partners.

            <br />
            <p>
              Working on the Sprinklr Community project was one of the most
              significant opportunities I had at Sprinklr. Since its launch in
              May 2024, the project has received a wealth of positive feedback
              from our clients.

          I worked with our UX team to define Core User Personas & Use Cases.
          This research was conducted by collecting extensive data directly from

          Previous Sprinklr design was created two years ago. While it
          successfully served as a platform to connect people, it fell short in
          driving meaningful engagement. I, along with another designer, was
          assigned to collaborate with our UX team and project managers to
          redesign this platform and transform it into the front door for all
          things Sprinklr. Our key focus areas include:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Connecting and Collaborating.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Inspiring, Learning and Growing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Accessing exclusive events and opportunities.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Gaining valuable knowledge and insights.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Through extensive research, including a deep dive into competitors
            like Salesforce, we identified a critical gap: the lack of
            gamification elements such as badges, leaderboards, and points.
            These features are proven to significantly boost user engagement by
            creating a sense of achievement and encouraging active
            participation. Integrating gamification into the new design will not
            only enhance the user experience but also drive continuous
            interaction within the community.

     Together with our principal
          designer, another designer, UXR and I worked on the required widgets for
          the homepage. The homepage will dynamically change based on whether
          users are prospects or registered users. After finalizing the
          necessary components, we began crafting the wireframe for the
          homepage.

          I designed the User Profile with gamification in mind, incorporating
          features such as Earned Badges, a Leaderboard, and Icons. Gamification
          is effective because it motivates users through rewards and
          recognition, fostering a sense of achievement and encouraging
          continued engagement. By integrating these elements, we aim to enhance
          user interaction and create a more dynamic and enjoyable experience.

          vibrant hub for inspiration, learning, and growth. Users can create
          discussions, access a wealth of resources, and receive expert advice.
          Additionally, with the integration of Sprinklr AI+, each discussion
          will be summarized, providing answers 75% faster. This improvement
          supports online customer communities by enabling community managers to
          monitor activity and troubleshoot more efficiently, allowing them to
          focus on high-priority tasks.

          The Sprinklr Platform offers over 50 AI models that elevate the digital experience for customers, optimizing both engagement and interaction. Recently, Sprinklr AI+ was integrated into the new Sprinklr Community, empowering users to summarize, generate ideas and content, and develop strategies.       </p>
          <p>   As a product designer, I played a key role in developing a feature where users can generate ideas or content through Community Search using Sprinklr AI+. This tool enables users to either receive AI-generated suggestions or explore further search results.</p>
       <p>  However, the design process presented several challenges. Balancing the user interface to be intuitive yet powerful was a significant hurdle. We had to ensure that AI-generated content was both relevant and contextually appropriate, which required extensive testing and fine-tuning of the AI models. Additionally, integrating this feature seamlessly into the existing community framework, without overwhelming users with options, was a complex task that required iterative design and feedback cycles.</p>

          Working on Sprinklr Community has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career as a product designer. Not only did I have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented team of designers, engineers, product managers, and researchers, but I also witnessed substantial growth in both my existing and newly developed skillsets over just six months. Seeing the product come to life and knowing that it will make a positive impact on users filled me with joy, pride, and gratitude. These feelings continue to drive my passion for design and inspire me to keep improving, both as a designer and as someone committed to making a difference through my work.       </p>
